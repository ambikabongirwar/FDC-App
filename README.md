# FDC-App
Environment challenge app

The idea behind this project is to develop an Android application for the ngo **Babul Films Society** which would spread awareness on environment protection by doing the FunDu Challenge. 

The user can login and either record the audio or video of themselves and share it to various social media platforms such as whatsapp, gmail, etc.
